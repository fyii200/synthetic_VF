# Introduction
Synthesise serial visual fields with and without progression using [Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks (Time-GAN)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/hash/c9efe5f26cd17ba6216bbe2a7d26d490-Abstract.html).

# Re-implementation of TS-GANs
Original [implementation](https://github.com/jsyoon0823/TimeGAN) by [Yoon et al. 2019](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/hash/c9efe5f26cd17ba6216bbe2a7d26d490-Abstract.html) uses Tensorflow software library. Our re-implementation of Time-GAN is adapted from [Zhiwei Zhang's](https://github.com/zzw-zwzhang/TimeGAN-pytorch?ref=pythonrepo.com) PyTorch implementation.   

# Data source
28,943 visual fields (VFs) from 7248 eyes of 3871 patients from the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Washington as described in this [paper](https://tvst.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2778219).
